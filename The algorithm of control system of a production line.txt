The algorithm of the control system of a production line :
A basic algorithm of controlling a production line in industries.

#The technique used:
using sensors and servo motors connected with the microcontroller to control the movement of the boxes in  the production line.




#How does this technique work ?
In each system are set,the sensors measure the tall of the boxes .according to the measurement ,
the sensors should send an input signal to the microcontroller. 
In the microcontroller we should dettermine the set values .
For example ,When the tall of the box  using the sinsor is between 200-150 cm that means the box is small 
so we shoould put the set value in the case to be 135 angle to send a singal from the micrcontroller 
to the servo motors to rotate and direct the boxes to the disered postion .


Note : setting the values and comparing them with the measured values are done in the microcontroller using some program languages. 


#What are the steps of this technique ?
1- Firstly ,the ultrasonic sensors read the distance (the tall of the boxes).
2-The readings (signals) are sent to the microcontrollers .
3-the microcontrollers compare the distances (measured values) with the set values( ture values).
4- According to the comparison between the set and measured values, the microcontroller makes a decision to directe the boxes to which direction .
5- The microcontroller sends an output signal (decision) to the servo motors. 
6- Finally, the servo motors are acctivated to take the  boxes to the desired deriction.
